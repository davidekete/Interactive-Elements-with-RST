Interactive Elements with Sphinx and reStructuredText
=====================================================

This document serves as a proof of concept to prove that simple interactive elements can be included in websites developed using reStructuredText.

This PoC will be using a fork of Canonical Sphinx-based documentation starter pack and feature a Docker command that allows users to configure and launch a containerized application with a specific environment and network settings on different platforms.
The easiest way to get help with the project is to join the #crawler
channel on Freenode.
We hang out there and you can get real-time help with your projects.
The other good way is to open an issue on Github.

The mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crawler 
is also available for support.
